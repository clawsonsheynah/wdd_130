      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
      <p>
        There are so many things to crochet! The things I love to crochet are dish cloths and coasters. A fun fact is the difference between crocheting and knitting is that in crochet, each stitch is completed before moving onto the next. In knitting, a large number of stitches may be kept open at once. Another fun fact about crocheting is that it has been proven to help with insomnia, stress, anxiety, and depression. Crocheting is healthy, it improves your overall health by significantly by reducing your stress level and lowering your blood pressure. They also improve circulation to your hands. Using both of your hands in different ways and stimulates your brain, thus giving your brain a workout not many other activities do. The crochet stitches that I use are the following: Single crochet, Double crochet, and treble crochet.
