      <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
      <p>
        There are so many things to crochet! The things I love to crochet are dish cloths and coasters. A fun fact is the difference between crocheting and knitting is that in crochet, each stitch is completed before moving onto the next. In knitting, a large number of stitches may be kept open at once. Another fun fact about crocheting is that it has been proven to help with insomnia, stress, anxiety, and depression.

    Here are some crochet patterns you can do. Polyester Yarns
    Polyester yarns are easy to make into baby blankets because they are a chenille style yarn that is soft and breathable. A good deal of crochet baby blanket patterns will have the size listed within in the pattern, but may also have sizes that are even larger. Be sure to look over the pattern you pick to be sure of the size baby blanket you are going to make. You will need a size K hook, and yarn needle. Use hook size I/9 (5.5mm) for teen adult small mitten.
    Use hook size J/10 (6.0 mm) for adult size medium.
    The final round at the cuff is worked into the posts of the previous round and creates the appearance of rolling. This is an intended part of the design. Insert hook into stitch, yarn over and pull through stitch (2 stitches on hook), insert hook into next stitch of round, yarn over and pull through stitch (3 stitches on hook), yarn over and pull through all 3 stitches on hook.
      </p>

        The final round at the cuff is worked into the posts of the previous round and creates the appearance of rolling. This is an intended part of the design.
        A small length of contrasting yarn may be used in place of a stitch marker. Weave the yarn upwards as you work rounds in the piece. See picture on page 10.
        The yarn used for these mittens contains natural fiber and requires special laundering. Please read yarn labels and follow directions to maintain the life of your crochet work.
